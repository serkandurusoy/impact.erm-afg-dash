      'Using the common Household Emergency Assessment Tool (HEAT) the partners gather detailed information on the household demographics, additional vulnerabilities, education, livelihoods, food security, WASH, shelter and priority needs. Based on the assessment ERM partners select and target beneficiaries for the ERM standard assistance. Accordingly the emergency assistance is targeted at directly conflict or disaster affected households, with a high level of vulnerability which have been recently displaced.',

The market assessments inform on whether the local markets are safe to access and whether prices of key commodities are within a reasonable range of the established baseline prices. The aim of the survey is not to provide a full supply chain and market analysis, but only to quickly assess the appropriateness of cash based assistance at that given time.',

The monitoring takes place two months after emergency assistance has been provided. It consists of a household survey and can include a Focus Group Discussion.',
      'The survey should include ten percent (10%) of the assisted households, or at least ten households for caseloads with less than 100 HHs assisted. It should be attempted to include an equal representation of men and women, especially for caseloads over 100 HHs. ERM partners are using for the household survey the common PDM questionnaire of the Cash and Voucher Working Group. The findings of the PDM allows the ERM partners to assess the quality and short-term outcomes of the multi-purpose cash assistance.',
